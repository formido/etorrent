Haphazard TODO list of things that needs attention:

* Warn if we get old ACKs, there seem to be no control of this.
   We better have a check for this, otherwise we can simply add a
   large number of dumb errors to the code base later on.

* We are currently sending the wrong ACK number back.
   This ought to be fixed.

* We don't update the advertized window at all.
   This ought to be fixed.

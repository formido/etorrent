Haphazard TODO list of things that needs attention:

* Warn if we get old ACKs, there seem to be no control of this.
   We better have a check for this, otherwise we can simply add a
   large number of dumb errors to the code base later on.

* We don't update the advertized window at all.
   We should begin planning how to handle the advertised window. We
   are currently killing the receiver because we are sending too fast
   and he has begun dropping packets.

   To make the window going:
   DONE ; Whenever we send out a packet, calculate the current window and
     stamp it into the packet
   ; Figure out how to set the advertised window on outgoing packets.

   ; Only send packets up to the window size.

Haphazard TODO list of things that needs attention:

* Warn if we get old ACKs, there seem to be no control of this.
   We better have a check for this, otherwise we can simply add a
   large number of dumb errors to the code base later on.

* We don't update the advertized window at all.
   We should begin planning how to handle the advertised window. We
   are currently killing the receiver because we are sending too fast
   and he has begun dropping packets.

   To make the window going:
   DONE ; Whenever we send out a packet, calculate the current window and
     stamp it into the packet
   DONE ; Figure out how to set the advertised window on outgoing packets.
   DONE ; Set window on outgoing advertised packets.

   ; Only send packets up to the window size.
   ; Figure out how to do this.
     It requires us to make a calculation based on the advertised
     window from the other end. When this is properly updated, we must
     calculate how many packets there are currently fitting into the
     window, and only send this amount to the other end.

   ; Handle the special case of a zero packet window. It is a quite
     important special-case because you should only open up the window
     again, if a full packet can be injected in-flight. Otherwise, you
     must let the other end keep processing stuff.
